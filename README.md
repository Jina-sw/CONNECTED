### What it does
"Connected" is an app that aims to assist users by providing resources for various struggles, facilitating connections with mentors who share similar experiences, and guiding users to helplines in case of urgent help.

### How we built it
React Native, Expo, JavaScript, C++

### Accomplishment we are proud of
Our passion for helping others was effectively delivered in this mobile app. The message and purpose we wanted to implement were created in all features this app has.

### Challenges we ran into
- The stacks we chose to work on weren't compatible with the laptops that one of the main front-end developer teammates owns. We debugged for hours and asked mentors for help but nobody was able to figure out what was wrong. Therefore, we had to take turns to use the "working" laptop.
- 12-hour limit, This 12-hour duration is not long at all!!

### Future Improvement
- Deploy
- Change Stacks for Back-End
- Back-end development
